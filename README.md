# Racism Breaker

The racist naming on GitHub needs to stop, here's how you can rename your branch from the racist term master which hurts black people to the much nicer and shorter word: main!

```bash
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
```

Now go to your favorite open source project and tell them to do the same, it ends today.

Open an issue if they fail to comply and we'll keep work towards publishing this list of the racist developers and organizations.
